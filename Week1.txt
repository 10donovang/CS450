For questions 2-6, please type "True" or "False" in front of the question number.

2. My experiment shell can correctly load the Iris dataset: true

3. My experiment shell randomizes the order of the instances (making sure to keep instances lined up with their appropriate targets) it and splits the data into a training set (70%) and a test set (30%)? true

4. I have GaussianNB algorithm on the dataset and received results. true

5. I have created a HardCoded classifier class with two methods: fit and predict. The fit method accepts training data (including targets). The predict method returns a prediction or classification for each instance it receives. true

6. The Experiment Shell, processes the data, passes the training data to the classifierâ€™s train method, the test data to the predict method, and then compares the predicted values against the correct answers, to produce an overall accuracy (on the test set). true

7. I have run the HardCoded classifier on the Iris dataset and obtained a result. true

8. What accuracy do you get when running the HardCoded classifier on the Iris dataset and why do you think that is? Around 30%. This is because about 1/3 of my data is Setosa. 



9. Please select the category you feel best describes your assignment:
1 - Some attempt was made
2 - Developing, but significantly deficient
3 - Slightly deficient, but still mostly adequate
4 - Meets requirements
5 - Shows creativity and excels above and beyond requirements

10. Provide a brief justification (1-2 sentences) for selecting that category: 5: I can't test some extra stuff I did but I am confident that it works.
